# MSBA_Predictive_Modeling
MSBA 2019

This repository contains 5 homework assignments and a link to a group project for the MSBA Advanced Predictive Modeling class.  

### HW1
This assignment covers multiple linear regression and Lasso and Ridge regression


### HW2
This assignment covers an example of the bias-variance trade-off, data required for multiple linear regression, missing value imputation, and conceptuals regarding principal component analysis.


### HW3
This assignment covers gradient descent algorithms, decision trees, and Bayes optimal classifiers.


### HW4
This assignment covers designing loss functions with rejection options, pipelines with scikit-learn, ROC curves, and calibration plots.


### HW5
This assignment covers Bayesian belief networks, ensemble methods, and voting classifiers.



## Semester Project
I was part of a group that investigated the strengths and drawbacks of automated machine learning and the its potential as a tool for model selection.  Check out our article and relevant code at https://towardsdatascience.com/the-death-of-data-scientists-c243ae167701
